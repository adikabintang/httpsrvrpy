# httpsrvrpy

A very minimal HTTP1.0 server.

# How to run

Requirement: Python 3.7+, Linux, Docker (optional)

To run, execute `make run` (or `python main.py` if you don't have a GNU `make`).

To build the docker image: `make docker_build`, and to run: `make docker_run`.

See [Makefile](Makefile) to see more info about running the sample.
